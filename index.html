		<p>According to the Smoking and Tobacco Products Usage (Control) Act 2005 (Amendment 2013), in its 5th Rule it is clearly stated that the advertisement, promotion and sponsorship of Tobacco products is absolutely prohibited in Bangladesh. To proper implementation of this Tobacco Control Act Grambangla Unnayan Committee had initiated a project with local partner organization “Save the Coastal People (SCOP)” in six sub-districts of Barishal Division (Babuganj, Nolcity, Kaukhali, Borhanuddin, Kuakata and Amtoli). This project is implemented with the financial and technical support from The Union and Bloomberg Initiative with the title “Implementation of Bans on Tobacco Advertising, Promotion and Sponsorship of Tobacco Control Laws of Bangladesh in Barishal Division”. In this two yearlong project (October’18 to September’20), a “Civil Society Action Committee” was made and successfully worked to implement this project in specific sub-districts of Barishal Division.</p>
